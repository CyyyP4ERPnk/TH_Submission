# This solution nestles a function inside our query; We're selecting the title from ouyr albums table with the first line of the script. 
# You specify the artist that you want to return query, and include the "AND" operator in your "WHERE" clause; We want to show titles with a price higher than the average
# price of the artist titles; so we specify within the function to make the selection from our album table, where our artist is named.
